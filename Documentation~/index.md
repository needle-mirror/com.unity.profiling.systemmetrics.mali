# About System Metrics Mali

Use the System Metrics Mali package to access low-level system or hardware performance metrics on devices that use ARM GPUs. For example, you can:

- Monitor low-level GPU metrics in the Unity Profiler.
- Use the Recorder API to access low-level GPU metrics at runtime.
- Automate performance testing with continuous integration test runs.

The System Metrics Mali package includes a Profiler module for monitoring low-level GPU metrics in the Unity Profiler window. For information on how to use modules in the Profiler Window, see [The Profiler window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProfilerWindow.html).
